## Project Description
#
This project is intended to create an internal polling application which will allow:

- Admin to create polls
- Users to respond to polls
- Both to see the total responses (possibly in the form of a graph)
- The ability to Login as a regular User
- The ability to Login as an Admin

## To Do
#
please consult the existing components before adding new components currently (as of 12/7/21) there should be a component for every item on the Jira board. As it stands the only components with any coding:
- CreatePoll.js
- Register.js

## Legacy Code
Feel free to pull code from here in order to build out the components. This code was only seperated out so that it could be rewritten in a more consistant and readable manner.
